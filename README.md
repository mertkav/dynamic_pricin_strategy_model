A Brief Introduction and Economic Approach to this model

Dynamic pricing strategy is an approach aimed at determining the maximum demand for each price point and, in turn, maximizing profit.
In Classical and partially Keynesian economic models, the supply curve is positioned relative to demand, and efforts are made to reach an equilibrium point. The supply curve is typically viewed as upward sloping, meaning that as prices rise, producers are willing to supply more of a good or service, up to a certain point. However, in todayâ€™s digital economic models, where the supply curve is often considered to have no inherent limit, applying a demand-based approach like dynamic pricing makes much more sense.
However, implementing and analyzing this model is challenging. Identifying the points at which maximum demand and profit occur depends on many variables, and these variables can change over time. Therefore, I will focus on two different approaches. 
One is an A/B testing-based approach, which is more suitable for applications with a smaller user base, where accurate analysis based on past data can be difficult. 
The other is a profit maximization with marketing campaign model, which is more applicable to applications with a large user base, focusing on predicting optimal pricing for maximum profit.
